Brace up, given the 50-over form and confidence these two sides are coming in here with we should have a seriously fun series. Don&#39;t forget the small boundaries too. Time for us to set out .. this is Vineet Anantharaman and on behalf of Sriram and Raju Peethala, it&#39;s ta ta!!</td>

                  <td>Kane Williamson: Dew was a factor tonight but we played most of our cricket before it set in. I thought they had a competitive total on the board and we knew we needed to have a skillful partnership to take us there, which was provided by Ross and Tom. There was definitely an assessment period when we went in to bat, with the wicket on the slower side, but full credit to the death bowlers bowling to guys like Jos Buttler. Keeping them to 70 in the last ten was a great effort. A good, even game of cricket in the end. Guys have their roles and it is fantastic to see the guys perform them. It was a fantastic partnership for us in the middle but Santner finished it superbly. Ross has been batting well through the season, Tom did it too and we did really well. Tim&#39;s batting has come along a long way and he strikes it cleanly. England too did well and required smart thinking on both parties. It&#39;s a different format, there&#39;s more time. We know how England play their cricket very positively with the bat, but we needed to assess and realize that it wasn&#39;t easy to score for the new guys coming in. We saw it from both teams.</td>

                  <td>Eoin Morgan, England skipper: Wasn&#39;t much between the sides today which was reflected in the result. We posted a good competitive score, courtesy Root, Roy and Buttler at the end and made really good inroads at the start. But they fought back really well, Ross showed what he&#39;s capable of and Latham was superb too. It ebbed and flowed for quite a while and when we broke the partnership we knew we were in the game. In the end we just didn&#39;t have enough runs in the tank. Dew definitely had a big role to play but New Zealand were the better side. We would have bowled first as well. A couple of them in the side need a bit of guidance and that&#39;s what we try to do.</td>

                  <td>Ross Taylor, MoM: It was one hell of a game today. England came out and posted a strong total. Tom came out and manipulated the ball well in the middle overs and took it from there. But Santner given the way he finished it off in the end was the difference. Apart from Root everyone struggled at the start, I just needed to take it deep and give us a chance. It is always a pleasure batting with Tom. The wicket was a bit two-paced, even the slower ones kissed off the surface. We backed ourselves to get 50 off the last five overs with these small boundaries and the guys took us over. I played with a bit of anger but I&#39;ll probably get back and nudge it around a little bit.</td>

                  <td>20:56 local: If this is a precedent for what is to come over the next couple of weeks, nail-cutters would be extinct. It was a foregone conclusion when Taylor and Latham were batting. And then when Rashid prized Taylor out. And then when Santner couldn&#39;t find a gap to save his life. Just what a 50-over contest gives you .. ebbs, flows and twists all through. In the end, it was Morgan&#39;s brave captaincy to bowl spin in the 48th over that went against England. But in the longer scheme of things, you&#39;d argue the way the Kiwi bowlers pulled things back in the death with the ball was the decider. Never mind, bask in what&#39;s just hit us, brutally as we ready up for the presentations.</td>
