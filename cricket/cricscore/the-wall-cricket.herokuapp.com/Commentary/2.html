Special credit to Shahid Afridi. I asked him if he wanted to go in but he told me to go in and hit the shot. It was a wicket where proper batsmen can score more runs. Enjoying captaincy.</td>

We didn&#39;t bat in partnerships. If you take out Dwayne&#39;s score, don&#39;t think anyone got good figures. The pitch was one where if you hit good lengths, you could ask questions. Proud of the guys to take it into the last few balls. Weren&#39;t upto scratch. Have a couple of days to get that right.</td>

It could have been even closer had the Zalmi taken even one of the plethora of chances which came their way towards the end. But it wasn&#39;t to be. There were contributions right through the batting order for Karachi. None of them really kicked on though which is why 132 was made to be a lot bigger than it should have. They&#39;ll be happy to get the job done nonetheless. Their second consecutive win in this competition.</td>
